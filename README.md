# Interesting_Tool

### The first tool achieves the function of transferring the voice to videos.


1. The first tool helps to record the voice. it is available that there are other recording files.
using tool: VOICE_TO_TEXT_v3_savetxt_juhao.html
(output: Original_text.txt)

2. The second tool helps to extract the word, converting voice to text.
   ![Original text extracted from recording file](./original.jpg)

4. Also, since the text file extracted from recording video does not contain any comma, so we add the comma based on some important words.
5. In the same tool, applying the OPENAI API, we summarizes and rephrases the whole paragraph.
using tool: M4P.ipynb
(output: optimized_text.txt)
